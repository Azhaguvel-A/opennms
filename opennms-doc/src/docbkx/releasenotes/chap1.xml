	<para>Release 1.6.0 is the first stable release in the OpenNMS 1.6 series.</para>

	<para>It's been 3 and a half years since the last OpenNMS stable version, 1.2, was
	branched and released as production-ready.  In that time, OpenNMS as a project has
	changed tremendously, the community has grown exponentially, and massive numbers of
	new features have been incorporated into the "unstable" 1.3.x series.
	</para>

	<para>In that time, the unstable codebase solidified to the point that The OpenNMS
	Group supported it as if it were stable; it was <emphasis>at least</emphasis> as
	stable as 1.2.x was, but many users held off on upgrading because of the unstable
	moniker.</para>

	<para>After a lot of work, and a renewed focus on getting the next stable release
	out the door, we are now prepared to declare OpenNMS 1.6 release-candidate-ready.</para>

	<para>Why 1.6 instead of 1.4?  3 years is a lot of time, and a lot has happened
	in that time.  We're not ready to call it 2.0, we want to redo the web UI first,
	but 1.4 didn't really do the massive changes since 1.2 justice.  So: 1.6 it is.</para>
	
	<para>Since it is a lot easier to do a release than it was in the 1.2 series (now
	that the native code is moved out into separate packages, and OpenNMS itself is
	distributed as pure-java sources), the goal is to continue to be on a much faster
	6-month or year cycle for new releases.</para>
