// 2008 Feb 02: Clean up logging and comments a bit. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 26: Pull the EventHandler code into EventIpcManagerEventHandlerProxy
//              and inject it.  Get rid of localHostAddress--it wasn't used.
//              Turn Tcp/UdpEventReceiver into just a list of EventReceivers
//              since we treat them all the same, anyway. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 26: Dependency inject the last of the objects.  Move local
//              host address code into DaemonUtils.  Reorganize so that
//              Ron* methods match the lifecycle ordering. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 26: Move m_serviceTableMap into JdbcEventdServiceManager. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 26: Get rid of the Eventd singleton and getInstance. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 17: Use JdbcTemplate for getting service name -> ID mapping. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 06: Dependency injection of EventConfDao, delay creation of
//              BroadcastEventProcessor until onInit instead of in
//              setEventIpcManager, and pass in EventConfDao. - dj@opennms.org
// 2008 Jan 06: Indent, format code, Java 5 generics, eliminate warnings,
//              use log() from superclass. - dj@opennms.org
// 2003 Jan 31: Cleaned up some unused imports.
// 2002 Nov 14: Used non-blocking socket class to speed up capsd and pollerd.

/**
 * <p>
 * Eventd listens for events from the discovery, capsd, trapd processes and
 * sends events to the Master Station when queried for.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Eventd receives events sent in as XML, looks up the event.conf and adds
 * information to these events and stores them to the db. It also reconverts
 * them back to XML to be sent to other processes like 'actiond'
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Process like trapd, capsd etc. that are local to the distributed poller send
 * events to the eventd. Events can also be sent via TCP or UDP to eventd.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Eventd listens for incoming events, loads info from the 'event.conf', adds
 * events to the database and sends the events added to the database to
 * subscribed listeners. It also maintains a servicename to serviceid mapping
 * from the services table so as to prevent a database lookup for each incoming
 * event
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * The number of threads that processes events is configurable via the eventd
 * configuration xml
