 * 2008 Mar 10: Need to autowire by name now that we have two EventIpcManagers
 *              (the real one and the proxy). - dj@opennms.org
 * 2008 Feb 16: Move testSendEventWithService to JdbcEventWriterTest and make
 *              this test case just about starting up the daemon with default
 *              bean wiring and configs so we can catch problems like bug #2273
 *              in the future. - dj@opennms.org
 * 2008 Feb 10: Fix failing test testSendEventWithService. - dj@opennms.org
 * 2008 Feb 05: Load up a smaller EventConfDao and run one more test. - dj@opennms.org
 * 2008 Jan 27: Enable the service test and make it do something for real. - dj@opennms.org
 * 2008 Jan 26: Created this file. - dj@opennms.org
