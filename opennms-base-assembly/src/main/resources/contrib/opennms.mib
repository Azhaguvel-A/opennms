-- Copyright (C) 2005-2008 by The OpenNMS Group, Inc.


-- Version 1.0 - 2005-01-13: 	The main purpose of this first version of
--				the OpenNMS MIB is to instrument the values
--				passed in the trap sent by scriptd in the
--				example configuration file.

-- Version 1.1 - 2005-12-01: 	Added the ifresolve and nodelabel fields
--				for events. Also greatly increased the text
--				associated with each object.

-- Version 1.2 - 2008-09-16:	Drop-cased first letter of all OBJECTs
--				to placate smilint.

-- Version 1.3 - 2008-09-16:	Added TL1-specific objects and trap definition

openNMS-event-operinst		OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX		DisplayString
	ACCESS		read-only

openNMS-event-nodelabel		OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX		DisplayString
	ACCESS		read-only
	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION 	"This will contain the name of the node as known by OpenNMS. 
			This is based solely on OpenNMS-event-nodeid and can be
			considered an authoritative way to identify the device from
			the perspective of OpenNMS.

			This name is automatically assigned in the following order:

			1) DNS Name: The reverse-resolved name of the primary
			interface for the node.

			2) NetBIOS Name: If available on a Windows or SMB system.

			3) SNMP sysName: If SNMP is available, the sysName.

			4) IP Address

			All of these methods can be overridden by an end user via the webUI, 
			and thus the value can change over time, although the 
			OpenNMS-event-nodeid will not."
